The compiled program can be found in the `Release` folder. The file `NumericalCWS2D.exe.config` [allows the allocation of large arrays](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/gcallowverylargeobjects-element) for data generation. `Manual.pdf` provides a brief manual of the program.
